import { DropEvent } from "@/models/DropEvent"

// Ensure DropEvent is exported correctly, creating the file if it was missing or partial
// Wait, listing showed DropEvent.ts exists. I'll assume it's good or check it later if errors.
// This step is creating the API, so I don't need to write the model unless it's missing.
// I'll proceed with layout.
